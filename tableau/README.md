#Tableau Workbooks
Below are descriptions of all the Tableau workbooks in this directory.

- **electricPercentSpent.twb**: A workbook that creates an interactive dashboard that shows the percent of income spent towards electric by state for 2014. The resulting visualization can be seen either on my Tableau Public page [here][TabPubPercSpent], or as the last figure (i.e. the shades of green) on my blog post about electric rates by state [here][BlogElec].

- **electricRatesByState201411.twb**: A tableau workbook that creates an interactive dashboard showing the average electric rates in the US by state. The resulting visualization can be seen either on my Tableau Public page [here][TabPubRates], or as the first figure (i.e. the shades of blue) on my blog post about electric rates in the US [here][BlogElec].

- **energyUsagePerCap201411YTD.twb**: A workbook that creates an interactive dashboard showing the average energy use by state in the US. The resulting visualization can be seen either on my Tableau Public page [here][TabPubUsage], or as the middle figure (i.e. shades of red) on my blog post about electric rates in the US [here][BlogElec].
